# Face_Mask_Detection_Project
This is a face mask detection project that uses deep learning techniques to determine whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The system is designed to process real-time images and classify them into two categories: mask and no mask.☺☺

#-------------------------------#
## Features
- Detects face masks in real-time using a webcam or pre-recorded videos.
- Pre-trained models provided for quick testing.
- Supports easy retraining with custom datasets.

#-------------------------------#
## Dataset
The project uses a public dataset of face mask images, including images of people with and without masks. Download the dataset used in this project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset/code).
